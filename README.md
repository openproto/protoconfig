The `OpenConfig 1.0` is a specification that describes a process of using, defining, and consuming software configuration input in a unified way.

*Like gRPC or OpenAPI but for Application (static or dynamic) Configuration.*

### TL;DR

The `OpenConfig 1.0` standardises application configuration, by describing the process as follows:

1. Application developer creates a [.proto](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) file with `Configuration Proto Definition`, that defines what exactly options application has.
2. Thanks to the single source of truth for your app configuration, a developer can generate a data structure in the language they need. Such structs/classes can be then used to parse incoming input in native proto or JSON encoding (for example from `stdin`, CLI flag or HTTP API, etc).
* `OpenConfig` allows generation extensibility, so such definition can be also used to generate documentation, `--help`, `man`, custom types, or even whole CLI flag & args parsing code. Options are unlimited!
3. Following the `OpenConfig` convention, a human or program can now configure the application either by specifying JSON manually or by generating (again) data structure from `Configuration Proto Definition` in the programming language they want. Such struct/class is typed (if a language is typed), have a valid format, have help commentaries and can be encoded to `protobuf` supported format and passed to the `configurable` application!

`OpenConfig 1.0` standard specifies that every `OpenConfig 1.0` compatible application accepts encoded `protobuf` in proto or JSON format as the way of configuring itself. Either as the only way or in addition to other conventions (e.g args and flags).

### Goals

Configure software in a way that is:

* **Discoverable** and **Type-Safe**: *We don't need to guess or read complex documentations to know application configuration format, invariants, and assumptions Configuration is defined by a single, typed [proto](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) package.*
* **Allows Auto Generation**: *We don't need to manually implement application client or data format to encode and similarly data format to parse. All can be safely generated thanks to `protobuf` in almost any programming language, thanks to the wide plugin ecosystem. Additionally, you can generate a full CLI flag paring code or even documentation(!). It also means the smallest, possible impact in the event of application upgrade or modification. Type, Default, or even Help changed can be easily tracked in any language.*
* **Easy to Verify**: *Non-semantic verification and validation (e.g ) do not require executable participation. No need for CLI --dry-run logic, or even invoking anything external. All can be validated from the point of `protobuf`.* https://github.com/envoyproxy/protoc-gen-validate
* **Backward & Forward Compatible**: *Smooth version migrations, thanks to `protobuf` guarantee and safety checkers like [`buf check breaking`](https://docs.buf.build/breaking-usage)*
* **Extensible**: *On top of [**OpenConfig Proto Extensions Format 1.0.**](proto/openconfig/v1/extensions.proto) this specification allows CLI or language-specific extensions (e.g see [`kingpinv2` Go package](golang/kingpinv2) and its [extensions](golang/kingpinv2/proto/openconfig/kingpinv2/v1/extensions.proto))*

### Motivation

See ["Configuration in 2021 is still broken"](https://deploy-preview-26--bwplotka.netlify.app/2020/configuring-sw-is-broken/)

### Principles

See [./specification#principles](specification.md#principles).

### Why Protocol Buffers and What is it

See [./specification#why-protocol-buffers](specification.md#why-protocol-buffers)

### Example

See [example in Go](golang/README.md).

If you are not familiar with Go, this is still a useful example, as the flow and pattern will be similar to any language.

### Roadmap

Help wanted!

* [ ] Documentation for using OpenConfig 1.0 by different language than supported by this repo.
* [ ] Documentation for writing OpenConfig 1.0 plugin for a different language than supported by this repo.
* [ ] Publish formal RFC-compatible specification
* [ ] Document extensibility.
* [ ] Large `protobuf` are hard to use. Standard should specify some solution when `Encoded Configuration Message` is larger than Megabytes.
* [ ] Unit tests.
