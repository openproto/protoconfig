# OpenConfig 1.0

The `OpenConfig 1.0` standard specifies a process of using, defining and consuming software configuration input in a unified way.

*`OpenConfig 1.0`  is like gRPC or OpenAPI but for Application (static or dynamic) Configuration.*

### Tl;DR

1. Application developer creates a [.proto](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) files with Configuration Definition, tha defines how to control the application. It's the single source of truth. 
2. Thanks to proto, developer can generate a data structure in the language they need. Such structs/classes can be then used to parse incoming input of bytes in native proto or JSON encoding (for example from stdin, CLI flag or HTTP API, etc).
3. `OpenConfig` allows generation extensibility, so such definition can be also used to generate documentation, `--help`, `man`, custom types or even whole CLI flag & args parsing. Options are unlimited. 
4. Following `OpenConfig` specification, human or program can now configure the application either by specifying JSON manually or by generating (again) data structure from `Configuration Proto Definition) in the programming they want. Such struct/class is typed (if language is typed), have valid format, have help commentaries and can be encoded to protobuf supported format and passed to the `configurable` application!

`OpenConfig 1.0` standard specifies that every `OpenConfig 1.0` compatible application accepts encoded protobuf in proto or JSON format as the way of configuring itself. Either as the only way or additionally to other conventions (e.g args and flags).

### Goals

Configure software in a way that is:

* **Discoverable** and **Type Safe**: *We don't need to guess or read complex documentations in order to know application configuration format, invariants and assumptions Configuration is defined by a single, typed [proto](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) package.*
* **Allows Auto Generation**: *We don't need manually implement application client or data format to encode and similarly data format to parse. All can be safely generated thanks to protobuf in almost any programming language, thanks to wide plugin ecosystem. Additionally, you can generate a full CLI flag paring code or even documentation(!). It also means the smallest, possible impact in the event of application upgrade of modification. Type, Default or even Help changed can be easily tracked in any language.*
* **Easy to Verify**: *Non-semantic verification and validation (e.g ) does not require executable participation. No need for CLI --dry-run logic, or even invoking anything external. All can be validated from the point of protobuf.*
* **Backward & Forward Compatible**: *Smooth version migrations, thanks to protobuf guarantee and safety checkers like [`buf check breaking`](https://docs.buf.build/breaking-usage)*
* **Extensible**: *On top of [**OpenConfig Proto Extensions Format 1.0.**](proto/openconfig/v1/extensions.proto) this specification allows CLI or language-specific extensions (e.g see [`kingpinv2` Go package](golang/kingpinv2) and its [extensions](golang/kingpinv2/proto/openconfig/kingpinv2/v1/extensions.proto))*

### Motivation

See ["Configuration in 2021 is still broken"](https://deploy-preview-26--bwplotka.netlify.app/2020/configuring-sw-is-broken/)

### Principles

See [./specification#principles](specification.md#principles).

### Why Protocol Buffers and What is it

See [./specification#why-protocol-buffers](specification.md#why-protocol-buffers)

### Example

See [example in Go](golang/README.md).

If you are not familiar with Go, this is still useful example, as the flow and pattern will be similar for any language.

### Roadmap

Help wanted!

* [ ] Documentation for using OpenConfig 1.0 by different language than supported by this repo.
* [ ] Documentation for writing OpenConfig 1.0 plugin for different language than supported by this repo.  
* [ ] Publish formal RFC-compatible specification
* [ ] Document extensibility.
* [ ] Large protobuf are really hard to use. Standard should specify some solution when `Encoded Configuration Message` is larger than Megabytes.
* [ ] Unit tests.

#### Open Questions:

##### Block protobuf bytes encoding completely? or actually make it mandatory?

This is tricky. From our experience configuration **has to be** human-readable, especially static one. However, there might be cases of configuration being large or maybe configuration process being latency critical. In those cases well compressible proto byte format shall be useful.

##### Standard should specify discoverability?

Discoverability of the protobuf is a big problem in the ecosystem (e.g `gRPC`). Ideally binaries are self-describing. There might be huge value in bringing
this topic here, but it could be also subject of another specification (as per `Focus on one thing well`).

For example:

> `CPD` Shall be embedded in the software executable/binary and available on demand. Note that this specification does not force any delivery mechanism as long as there is one.
>  * It's recommended to expose `openconfig.v1` argument or flag that will output embedded `CPD`  in `.proto` format.
>  * For web applications it's recommended to also expose `/openconfig/v1` endpoint that returns `CPD`  `.proto` format.

The above assumes `CPD` is self-contained which conflicts with below points about extensibility.
